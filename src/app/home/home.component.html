<div style="margin:5px; font-family:Lato; overflow:scroll; overflow-x: hidden"><h1>Berg Balance Scale</h1> <p>The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was developed to measure balance among older people with impairment in balance function by assessing the performance of functional tasks. It is a valid instrument used for evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions and for quantitative descriptions of function in clinical practice and research. The BBS has been evaluated in several reliability studies. A recent study of the BBS, which was completed in Finland, indicates that a change of eight (8) BBS points is required to reveal a genuine change in function between two assessments among older people who are dependent in ADL and living in residential care facilities.</p><p>Description:</p><p>14-item scale designed to measure balance of the older adult in a clinical setting.</p> Equipment needed:<p>  Ruler, two standard chairs (one with arm rests, one without), footstool or step, stopwatch or wristwatch, 15 ft walkway</p> Completion:<p></p> Time:<p>15-20 minutes</p> Scoring:<ul><li>A five-point scale, ranging from 0-4.</li> <li>“0” indicates the lowest level of function and “4” the highest level of function.</li> <li>Total Score = 56</li> <li>Interpretation:41-56 = low fall risk</li> <li>21-40 = medium fall risk 0 –20 = high fall risk</li></ul> A change of 8 points is required to reveal a genuine change in function between 2 assessments</div>
