<div>Berg Balance Scale The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was developed to measure balance among older people with impairment in balance function by assessing the performance of functional tasks. It is a valid instrument used for evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions and for quantitative descriptions of function in clinical practice and research. The BBS has been evaluated in several reliability studies. A recent study of the BBS, which was completed in Finland, indicates that a change of eight (8) BBS points is required to reveal a genuine change in function between two assessments among older people who are dependent in ADL and living in residential care facilities.Description:14-item scale designed to measure balance of the older adult in a clinical setting. Equipment needed:   Ruler, two standard chairs (one with arm rests, one without), footstool or step, stopwatch or wristwatch, 15 ft walkway Completion: Time:15-20 minutes Scoring:A five-point scale, ranging from 0-4. “0” indicates the lowest level                         of function and “4” the highest level of function. Total Score = 56 Interpretation:41-56 = low fall risk 21-40 = medium fall risk 0 –20 = high fall risk A change of 8 points is required to reveal a genuine change in function between 2 assessments</div>
